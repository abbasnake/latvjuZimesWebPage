- key shortcuts
- tooltip
- decide on layout for each screen size
- canvas ratio
- export svg (maybe just the file with coordinates to be put in some other program and right click save as for reference)
- sticky screen editor
- links to info about the simbols
- make gallery (the about and info page later I guess)
- style the shit out of the sliders
- organize the store better (function names, getter names etc)
- maybe circular simbol selector small screen setting is a slider on one line instead of forming 2 rows (maybe select name and the simbol appears next to it)
- save settings for later use
- when right click download, the image background is transparent
