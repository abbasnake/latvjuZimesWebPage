- key shortcuts
- tooltip
- decide on layout for each screen size
- canvas ratio
- export svg (maybe just the file with coordinates to be put in some other program and right click save as for reference)
- sticky screen editor
- links to info about the simbols
- make gallery (the about and info page later I guess)
- organize the store better (function names, getter names etc)
- maybe circular simbol selector small screen setting is a slider on one line instead of forming 2 rows (maybe select name and the simbol appears next to it)
- save settings for later use
- when right click download, the image background is transparent
- animate from one setting to next
- add fractal levels to simbols (wont work for all of them)
- info popup (multi-screen view - start here view, about view, controls view, underlying architecture view)
- write to library aout linkink to some online archive of simbols and their meanings
- maybe add simbol meanings as popups right here?

TODO TREES:
- responsiveness: 
  1) title text
  2) canvas itself
  3) canvas -> simbol name
  4) canvas -> help icon
  5) controls -> selector
  6) controls -> buttons
  7) controls -> sliders

- popup:
  1) decide on layout/style
  2) make layout/style
  3) make a button to dispatch popup

- make tests (jest?) for logic:
  1) jest vs karma? jest I guess
  2) decide what parts need testing
  3) make tests
  4) test tests

- keyboard shortcuts:
  1) what are the necessary/common shortcuts
  2) implement the keys
  3) test keys

- make save settings button:
  1) how to do it? (localhost or something else)
  2) implement this feature
  3) test feature (with jest?)

- add fractal setting to some/all simbols:
  1) decide which simbols could benefit from this feature
  2) decide how to implement this feature (different steps for different simbols)
  3) implement feature
  4) test feature
